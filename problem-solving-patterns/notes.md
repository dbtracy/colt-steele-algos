Some patterns

1. Frequency counter

  - uses objects/sets to collect values/frequencies of values
  - can avoid need for nested loops, O(n^2) stuff

2. Multiple pointers

  - create pointers/values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end, or middle
  - very efficient for solving problems w/ minimal space complexity as well
