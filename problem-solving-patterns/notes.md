Some patterns

1. Frequency counter

  - uses objects/sets to collect values/frequencies of values
  - can avoid need for nested loops, O(n^2) stuff

2. Multiple pointers

  - create pointers/values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end, or middle
  - very efficient for solving problems w/ minimal space complexity as well

3. Sliding window

  - create a window which can be either an array or number from one position to another
  - depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created)
  - very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc

4. Divide and conquer

  - dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process w/ a subset of data
  - can tremendously decrease time complexity
  - example: binary search!
