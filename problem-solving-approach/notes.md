Problem Solving
-Understand the problem
-explore concrete examples
-break it down
-solve/simplify
-look back and refactor

**Just like Reacto!!!

1. Understand the Problem
  - can i restate the problem in my own words?
  - what are the inputs?
  - what are the outputs?
  - can outputs be determined from inputs? do i have enough info?
  - do you have enough info to solve problem?
  - how should i label important pieces?

2. Concrete examples
  - examples help understand problme
  - provide sanity checks that your solution works
  - User stories! they are examples
  - Unit tests! also examples

  - simple examples
  - progress to more complex examples
  - explore exmples with empty inputs
  - explore examples with invalid inputs

3. Break it down (your approach)
  - explicity write out steps you need to take
  - forces you to think about code before you write it
  - helps you catch lingering questions

4. Solve/simplify (code!)
