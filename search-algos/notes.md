Searching Algorithms

Linear Search

-How do we search?
  -simplest way: look at every element (linear search)
    -indexOf
    -includes
    -find

-Linear Search Big O: O(n)

Binary Search

-much faster
-rather than eliminating one element at a time,
you eliminate HALF at a time
-Divide and Conquer!
